# There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.
# Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. 
# So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
# Example - Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
# Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards do you end up with?
