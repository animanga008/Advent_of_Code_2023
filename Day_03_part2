# The missing part wasn't the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. 
# A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. 
# Its gear ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.

# What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
