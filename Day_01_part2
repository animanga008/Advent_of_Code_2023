# Your calculation isn't quite right. 
# It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
# Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line.

# What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
