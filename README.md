"Advent of Code" is an annual online programming event created by Eric Wastl, where participants solve a series of programming puzzles throughout the month of December, leading up to Christmas. The event typically starts on December 1st and runs until December 25th, with a new puzzle released each day.

Each puzzle is designed to be solved using programming skills across various domains such as algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and problem-solving techniques. The difficulty level of the puzzles can vary from relatively straightforward to quite challenging, catering to programmers of different skill levels.

Participants are encouraged to solve the puzzles using any programming language of their choice and can submit their solutions to receive points. Leaderboards are maintained to track participants' progress and compare their solutions with others. Additionally, the event fosters a sense of community, as participants often share their approaches, discuss strategies, and collaborate in online forums and social media platforms.
